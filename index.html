                            <h3>What is SSL?</h3>
                            <p>
                                SSL or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. In a simple terms, SSL is like a digital lock that protects your online communications. When you see a website address that starts with "https" instead of "http", it means the wesbite is using SSL to encrypt your data. This makes it harder for a middle man(or hacker) to intercept and steal your personal information such as credit card number, login details, and so on.

                            <h3>What is TLS?</h3>
                            <p>
                                TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communications over a computer network. It's essentially the modern version of SSL that offers stronger encryption, improved authentication, and enhanced protection against vulnerabilities. While you might still hear people refer to "SSL certificates," they are actually TLS certificates in most cases.

                            <h3>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h3>
                            <p>
                                One way to know if a webpage is secure is if the URL starts with  "https" instead of "http". Another way is that in most web browsers, you will see a small padlock icon in the address bar to suggest that the webpage is secure.

                            <h3>What does it mean to be secure?</h3>
                            <p>
                                By saying something is secure, it means its being protected from harm, danger, or loss. In the context of a webpage, a secure webpage is one that protects user's data from being intercepted, modified, misused or stolen. User's information such as credit card details, passwords in the wrong hands poses serious risk to the user, families, friends and workplace.

                            <h3>What is encryption and why do I care?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Encryption is a process of encoding data in a way that makes it unreadable to anyone who does not have the corrent decryption key to descrypt the encrypred data. In simple terms, you can view encryption as locking a message with a secret code. You should care because encryption helps protect your personal information from being intercepted and misused by unauthorized parties. When one uses websites that are encrypted, one tend to be more confident that their data is safe.

                            <h3>Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about secure websites?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Definitely, the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when talking about secure websites. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the standard protocol for transfering data on the internet and not encrypted. Whereas, HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data transferred on the internet.

                            <p>
                                    An SSL certificate authority (CA) is a trusted third-party that issues digital certificates that verify the identity of a website and establish a secure connection between the website and the user's device. When you visit a website using HTTPS, your browser checks the website's certificate to ensure it's valid and issued by a trusted CA.
